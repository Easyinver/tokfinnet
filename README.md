## Features

Tokfin provides a compatibility layer of EVM, so that you can run any Ethereum dapps on Polkadot, unmodified.
Using Tokfin, you get access to all the Ethereum RPC APIs you are already familiar with, and therefore you can continue to develop your dapps in your favourite Ethereum developer tools.
As a bonus, you can even run many Ethereum L2s inside Tokfin!
For those looking to become acquainted with Tokfin, consult the documentation provided [here](./docs).
Additionally, a [template node](./template/README.md) is available to facilitate a more comprehensive technical exploration.

Tokfin is also a migration framework.
Besides the common strategy of direct state export/import and transaction-level replays, Tokfin's Pre-Log Wrapper Block feature provides a possible method for a zero-downtime live migration.

### New Features

* **Native Token:** The native token for this template has been configured to **TOKFIN** with the symbol **TKF**.
